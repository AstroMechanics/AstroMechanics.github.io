## Website and Codebase

This website's code is entirely open source and is hosted here.  In addition to the html, css and javascript code that controls the website itself, Python code used to generate all the figures shown on the site can also be found under 'code'.  A few Mathematica notebooks outlining derivations can also be found, and may be useful - but these notebooks are unmaintained.
