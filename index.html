  <h1> Astro Mechanics </h1>

  <p>Welcome to the astromechanics page!  This site is intended to be a pedagogical resource for anyone interested in learning about celestial mechanics.  The material discussed is aimed at advanced undergrads or early graduate students in astronomy/physics. We make pretty liberal use of animations and interactive figures on this site, to try and help build intuition for many of the mathematical and physical phenomena we address. The code to generate all of these figures is freely available at this site's <a href="https://github.com/AstroMechanics/AstroMechanics.github.io">Github repo.</a>  </p>

  <p>While we aim to take a pretty general view of the subject, by necessity won't be able to cover all interesting dynamical phenomena.  We hope that over time this page will grow to explore more aspects of celestial mechanics! Enjoy exploring! </p>

  <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

  <p>This site would not exist without the efforts of a great many people, who have written code, helped debugging, published textbooks or contributed to celestial mechanics in other ways. In particular, this site has been built on a combination of Python, Matplotlib, and Rebound code.  In addition, much of our code makes use of the animate module, which relies heavily on the ffmpeg code.</p>

  <p>In addition, previous references on celestial mechanics provided valuable insight into many of these problems.  Of particular use were: <br>
 
  <b>Solar System Dynamics, by Carl Murray and Stanley Dermott </b> <br>
  <b>The Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Effect and Its Applications by Smadar Naoz </b> <br>
  <b>Introduction to Celestial Mechanics by Richard Fitzpatrick </b> <br>
