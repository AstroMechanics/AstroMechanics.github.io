A list of stuff that may be worth covering in the future:
	Nonlinear Dynamics
	butterfly orbits
	Potential/Force due to massive ring?
	Canonical transformations
	Laplace Coefficient, needed in disturbing function expansions. 
	Derivation of spherical harmonics
	First order MMR.
	CR3BP or ER3BP
	Kozai Oscillaitons
	Phase space comparison of sympletic integrators.
	Superconvergence occurs for the earth-sun system for the 3rd and 4th order integratros. This is a good excuse to explore that.
